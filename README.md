# DesktopAssistant
Created a Desktop assistant using python. which is recognise your Message or Instruction given by voice. Then respond correspondingly.

 The basic idea behind this project is to create a simple stand-alone
application
 that helps less tech savvy people in the world to use the computer
without feeling ignorant or computer illiterate.
 Computers have became a very important devices and as well as
less expensive over time.
 The application works same like Siri/ Google Assistant etc. But the
application deals with the computer itself mainly.
 The U.I of the application is self-explanatory and minimal.
 Currently it takes text as input as most of the people are not very
good at speaking.
